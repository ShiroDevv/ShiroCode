# ShiroCode

## A small project text editor.
This is a small text editor, that currently is only allowing .txt files (To not ruin any good code)

## Current Features

### Directory Viewer ***Currently disabled***
This will allow you to Select a directory, and shows all editable files in the directory.

### Save-States
It shows whether or not the code you are currently working on has been saved, with a *.<br>
***THIS DOES NOT SAVE OLD FILE EDITS TO CACHE. IF YOU CHANGE FILES, OLD EDITS ARE DELETED.***

### Multiple files
Creates buttons so you can hot-swap between files. Just make sure to save them.

### Thats it for now!
The UI isn't that nice, but everything will be updated to look better once the projects main functionality works.
